# Solid Panel Mandate

The Solid Panel (also referred to as Solid community) are individuals and groups who are using or working on implementing Solid who may be occasionally consulted for their opinion on a specific project by the Solid Team. 

## Solid Panel Nomination 

The criteria to apply to be on the Solid Panel include: 
* Solid Team Member
* former [MIT Solid Project Team Member](https://solid.mit.edu) 
* Active Identity provider  
* Active Pod provider
* Active Solid app providers 
* Active Solid Users who show a minimum engagement of having a WebID, Pod, and use at least one Solid app regularly and actively
* Experts in a field relevant to Solid 

As soon as there is a Solid Test Suite it will be a requirement for identity providers, Pod providers, and Solid app providers to pass the Solid test to be able to participate in the Solid Panel. 

Applicants need to get a GitHub account to apply to join the Solid Panel. To apply the applicant must submit a pull request to the Solid Panel listing and add their name, contact details, and how they fulfil the criteria. If all Solid Team members except the Solid Leader review the pull request positively then the applicant becomes a formal Solid Panellist. If a Solid Team member abstains from approving or expresses some hesitation, then the applicant must be approved by the Solid Leader to formally become a Solid Panellist. 

## Solid Panel Removal 

Solid Panellists may resign their position at any time. 

If a Solid Panellist drops out of touch and cannot be contacted for several weeks without notification, then they may be removed from the Solid Panel. 

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Solid Panel against their will. (For example: egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations.) This can be accomplished by a pull request reviewed by all  Solid Team members except the Solid Leader. If a Solid Team member abstains from approving or expresses some hesitation, then the removal of the Solid applicant must be reviewed by the Solid Leader to be formally removed. 

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Team members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers, the mere appearance of any one company dominating Solid development could itself be harmful and erode trust. In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, at most 30% of the Solid Panel can work for any single employer. Solid Panellist applicants who apply when there is already 30% of the Solid Panel working for their employee will be put on hold until there are more applications from other employers or there are Solid Panellist resignations.
