# Solid Panels

Below is a listing of [Solid Panels](README.md#solid-panels). Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific problem or domain relevant to Solid, with an aim to propose changes to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, and/or Supporting Documentation. Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel.

Anyone can create a Solid Panel by submitting a request to the Solid W3C community group mailing list, or by making a pull request directly to this document.

This listing helps people find panels they may want to participate in, and helps editors find panels to consult as part of the editorial process.

- creating a structure for the document at https://github.com/solid/specification/, and the division in documents it links to;
