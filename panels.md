# Solid Panels

Below is a listing of [Solid Panels](README.md#solid-panels). Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific problem or domain relevant to Solid, with an aim to propose changes to the Solid Specification, Solid Roadmap, and/or Supporting Documentation. Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel.

Anyone can create a Solid Panel by submitting a request to the Solid W3C community group mailing list, or by making a pull request directly to this document.

This listing helps people find panels in which they may want to participate, and helps editors find panels to consult as part of the editorial process.

## Example Panel
This is an example that people can use as a template for submitting their own panels. A description of the panel, including its focus and goal, should go here.
