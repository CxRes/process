# Solid Team Mandate

The Solid Team are dedicated trusted stewards of Solid fulfilling defined [roles and responsibilities](solid-team.md#solid-team-roles-and-responsibilities). 

The Solid Team has broad authority, which they seek to exercise as rarely as possible, when necessary to ensure the viability and integrity of Solid, while at the same time fostering a collaborative, transparent, and supportive environment for contribution. The Solid Leader heads the Solid Team and can veto decisions and adjust direction as they see fit. 

Solid Team members have admin rights on all Solid repositories, managed properties and assets, and communication channels. They are expected both to participate in regular community group meetings and to maintain availability for project-specific collaboration as needed.

The mandate of the Solid Team includes but is not limited to:

* __Solid Culture__ - Ensure that the Solid culture makes contributing as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible  while maintaining the quality and stability of Solid. Providing clarity and fair implementation of appropriate decision-making processes and seeking consensus among those building on Solid and using Solid before acting in a formal capacity. Acting as a court of final appeal for decisions where all other methods have failed. Coordinating the definition of the Solid values so they are accurate and inclusive. Make contributing and/or participating in the evolution of Solid as accessible, inclusive, and sustainable as possible.
* __Solid Governance__ - Implement appropriate decision-making processes, ensuring that decisions and associated processes are always aimed towards furtherance of Solid. Coordinate votes with the Solid panel by defining the question clearly and neutrally, communicating the vote to all relevant parties effectively, and collecting the opinions of all relevant parties fairly and neutrally as well as communicating the outcome of the vote. Where necessary, act as a court of final appeal for decisions where all other methods have failed. 
* __Solid Communication__ - Promoting awareness of Solid and coordinating the several parties implementing the Solid specification. Providing an updated list of Solid solutions. Fostering awareness and use of Solid across geographic, economic, industrial, and academic verticals.
* __Solid Specification__ - Guiding the evolution of the Solid Specification, with an aim to encourage constructive dialogue and foster changes that result in healthy successive iterations aligned with the Solid Roadmap. Coordinating the definition of the Solid specifications including from technical, legal, and design perspectives. 
* __Solid Compliance__ - Creation and curation of the [Solid Test Suite](https://github.com/solid/test-suite), which any Solid specification compliant server must pass to be considered a fully compliant implementation. Coordinating the development of a Solid Test suite to automate the checking of compliance of solutions to the Solid specifications. 
* __Solid Projects__ - Providing examples of the Solid specification under open source licensing. Sanction and oversight of any repositories hosted under the [Solid GitHub organization](https://github.com/solid/), including sanctioned initiatives undertaken by Solid Panel groups and/or the Solid Team, and open source community reference implementations of the Solid Specification in different languages and technical stacks.
* __Solid Roadmap__ - Curation of the Solid Roadmap comprised of a description of the Solid mission and key success factors. The Solid Team works to ensure that any and all decisions, priorities, and output are always in alignment with the Solid Roadmap.
* __Solid Website__ - Curation and Management of the [Solid Website](https://www.solidproject.org).
* __Solid Brand__ - Definition and evolution of the Solid Brand, including any associated brand assets.
* __Solid Communication Channels__ - Sanction and oversight of official Solid project communication mediums, such as chatrooms, forums, mailing lists, and message boards.

The Solid Team has broad authority to make decisions about Solid. For example, they can: 
* Formally accept or reject suggestions (usually in the form of a GitHub pull request or issue) 
* Enforce or update the Solid project's code of conduct 
* Manage Solid assets and infrastructure, including the Solid Github organisation and repositories, the bug tracker, mailing lists, conversation channels etc.

However, the Solid Team cannot modify this decision-making process or affect the membership of the Solid Panel (see below for description of Solid Panel), except via the mechanisms specified in this decision-making process document. 

The Solid Team should look for ways to use these powers as little as possible. Instead of voting it's better to seek consensus. Instead of ruling on individuals it's better to define standard processes for decision making. It's better to establish a Code of Conduct committee than to rule on individual cases, etc. 

# Solid Team Roles and Responsibilities

## Solid Team Nomination

The Solid project was started by Tim Berners-Lee, who has served as the Solid Leader from inception.

The Solid Leader directly appoints the first Solid Team for a five-year appointment who consist of: 

| Individual            | Role                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Tim Berners-Lee       | [Leader](#solid-leader)           |
| Mitzi László          | [Manager](#solid-manager)         |
| Ruben Verborgh        | [Solid Specification Manager](#solid-specification-manager) |
| Justin Bingham        | [Solid Website Manager](#solid-website-manger) |
| Kjetil Kjernsmo       | [Solid Research](#solid-research-manager) |

Following Solid Teams will be selected via election.  A new Solid Team is elected after five years.

A Solid Team election consists of two phases: 
* Phase 1: Candidates advertise their interest in serving. Candidates must be nominated by a Solid team member. Self-nominations are allowed.

* Phase 2: Each individual on the Solid Panel can vote for zero to five of the candidates. Voting is performed anonymously. Candidates are ranked by the total number of votes they receive. If a tie occurs, it may be resolved by mutual agreement among the candidates, or else the winner will be chosen at random.

Each phase lasts one to two weeks and should be publicly communicated. The election process is managed by the Election Manager nominated by the outgoing Solid Team. 

The Solid Team should ideally reflect the diversity of individuals building on Solid and using Solid. The Solid Decision Panel is encouraged to vote accordingly.

## Solid Team Removal 

Solid Team members may resign their position at any time. 

Solid Team members may take sick leave or pregnancy leave and an election will take place to appoint an interim individual. 

If a Solid Team member not on a leave of absence drops out of touch and cannot be contacted, then the rest of the Solid Team may vote to initiate an Solid Team election as described. 

Whenever there is a vacancy during the regular Solid Team term, an election will take place as described above to appoint a replacement to serve out the rest of the term.

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Solid Team against their will. (For example: egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations.) This can be accomplished by a Solid Panel vote, but unlike other votes, this requires at least a two-thirds majority.

A no-confidence vote is triggered when a Solid Panel member calls for one publically on an appropriate project communication channel, and ten other Solid Panel members second the proposal. The vote lasts for two weeks. Solid Panel members vote for or against. If at least two thirds of voters express a lack of confidence, then the vote succeeds.

There are two forms of no-confidence votes: those targeting a single member, and those targeting the Solid Team as a whole. The initial call for a no-confidence vote must specify which type is intended. If a single-member vote succeeds, then that member is removed from the Solid Team and the resulting vacancy can be handled in the usual way. If a whole-Solid Team vote succeeds, the Solid Team is dissolved and a new Solid Team election is triggered immediately.

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Team members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers, the mere appearance of any one company dominating Solid development could itself be harmful and erode trust . In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, at most 2 members of the Solid Team can work for any single employer. This does not apply for the first appointment of the first Solid Team because there is a single dominant employer working on Solid at the time. 

In a Solid Team election, if 3 of the top 5 vote-getters work for the same employer, then whichever of them ranked lowest is disqualified and the 6th-ranking candidate moves up into 5th place; this is repeated until a valid Solid Team is formed.

During a Solid Team term, if changing circumstances cause this rule to be broken (for instance, due to a Solid Team member changing employment), then one or more Solid Team members must resign to remedy the issue, and the resulting vacancies can then be filled as normal election.
