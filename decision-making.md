# Decision Making Process

We employ a framework for making decisions on the Solid Team and across Solid Panels. As a general rule, this framework should be applied to any substantial choices at a Team or Panel level to ensure informed and thoughtful decisions.

This process may take place on or across different mediums. Wherever it transpires, what is most important is that the process is inclusive for those individuals that have a part in making the decision, and transparent for those who would be impacted by the same.

1. __Identify the Problem__ - The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved must be well understood. This includes an understanding of how solving the problem supports the Solid Roadmap.

2. __Lay out Options__ - Detail reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made.

3. __Invite Conversation__ - Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

  *If you'd like to add this to the agenda of an upcoming community group meeting, you will need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group, then request that it be added to the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified, and therefore are able to review and/or comment ahead of the call.*

4. __Reach Consensus or Vote__ - Decision makers should strive to reach a simple consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, they should conduct a vote by simple majority.

5. __Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).
