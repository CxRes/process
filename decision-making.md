# Making Suggestions to Solid 

Anyone can suggest a change by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the relevant repository on the Solid GitHub account. 

__Identify the Problem__ - The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved must be well understood. This includes an understanding of how solving the problem supports the Solid Roadmap.

__Lay out Options__ - Detail reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made.

You can post the pull request or issue on the relevant channels to invite conversation. 

Anyone can suggest routes forward to the suggested changes with pros and cons of each route forward on the original pull request or issues. 

Below is a possible table format where all the final suggested routes forward, pros and cons could be included when the conversation becomes longer and more complex. 

| Route Forward | Pros to Consider | Cons to Consider |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  |

This step is to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts on all the options and their opinions of each so that they feel that all the options are given a chance.

If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification you will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification then you will need to state why this change is necessary. For example, is it to remove ambiguity or to provide a more beautiful solution to something that is already solved.

__Invite Conversation__ - Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

# Decisions by the Solid Team 

Decisions on if and how a suggestion should be incorporated are made by the Solid Team. 

Decisions about Solid other than appointing individuals to roles, such as those listed below, are made in the following way. 

* Changes to the Solid specification
* Changes to the [Solid roadmap](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roadmap.md)
* Changes to the Solid Test Suite
* Starting or changing the aim or project manager of a [Solid Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) i.e. a GitHub project in the Solid Github account

To use its powers, the Solid Team votes. The Solid leader can always veto the voting outcome. Every Solid Team member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Members with conflicts of interest on a particular vote must abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members.

Whenever possible, the Solid Team's deliberations and votes shall be held in public.

This process may take place on or across different mediums. Wherever it transpires, what is most important is that the process is inclusive for those individuals that have a part in making the decision, and transparent for those who would be impacted by the same.

If a Solid Team speaks on behalf of the Solid Team they must reference a record of the vote that has been recognised by all Solid Team members except the Solid Leader. The Solid Leader should always be made aware of decisions and has the ability to veto a decision at any point.

The original pull request or issue needs to be open for one week unless it's a typo correction.

__Reach Consensus__ - Decision makers should strive to reach a simple consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, they should conduct a vote by simple majority as explained in the elaborate consultation process.

__Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).

# Solid Team Consultations of the Solid Panel 
The Solid Team can consult the Solid Panel for advice. To determine the collective voice of the Solid Panel a voting process occurs in the following way. 

Anyone can trigger a Solid Panel vote by submitting a pull request to the vote record. The pull request must define the particular issue that should be considered as well as who should be able to vote i.e. if they should have a particular Solid skin in the game affiliation or area of expertise. The pull request must be left open for feedback on the exact wording and details of the issue itself as well as who should be able to vote. Feedback can also be provided on voting options (if it is multiple choice) and pros and cons to consider with each route. 

The Solid Team collects the options, pros, and cons, and then make sure that everyone on the Solid Panel receives a complete copy of all the information via the github pull request and issue.

Once the formal vote question and who is allowed to vote is approved by all Solid Team Members expect the Solid Leader then an issue can be opened. The issue will clearly define the question and who can vote and the Solid Team is responsible for circulating the issue amongst all Solid Panellists who qualify. 

Solid Panellists are given one week to vote on the issue. 

Each individual in the Panel has one vote even if they have multiple criteria for being in the Solid Panel, so each person in the Panel has an equal voice. Each individual can vote on a first and second choice, or they can abstain. Each individual in the Panel has seven days to vote. If the individual does not vote after seven days their vote will automatically be counted as an abstaining vote. After counting the first choice votes, the votes from the bottom three options get transferred to the second choice vote to avoid strategic voting that does not reflect the true opinion of the Panel. The votes are recounted and the majority vote wins. 

The Solid Team's responsibilities are to:  
* make sure everyone on the Panel is aware of the vote
* explain how they can vote
* collect the final results
* communicate the outcome

# Solid Specification 

Solid specification 0.9 will be released on July 1st, and new versions of the Solid specification will be released every six months. For a change to the Solid specification to be merged there needs to be at least one working implementation that adheres to the changed Solid specification.
