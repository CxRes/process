__Making Suggestions__ 
Anyone can suggest a change by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the relevant repository on the Solid GitHub account. The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved in the interest of Solid must be well explained. 

__Inviting Conversation__ - 
Once you submit a suggestion be sure to post the pull request or issue on the relevant channels to invite conversation. 
The Solid Team can ask a specific Solid Panel for their thoughts on that specific opinion. This is done by inviting the Solid Panel to comment directly on the pull request or issue. 

If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification you will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. If the suggestion is a change to the Solid specification then you will need to state why this change is necessary. For example, is it to remove ambiguity or to provide a more beautiful solution to something that is already solved.

Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

__Lay out Options__ - Enphasis needs to be placed on detailing reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made. Anyone can suggest routes forward to the suggested changes with pros and cons of each route forward on the original pull request or issues. 

Below is a possible table format where all the final suggested routes forward, pros and cons could be included when the conversation becomes longer and more complex. 

| Route Forward | Pros to Consider | Cons to Consider |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  | (insert suggestion)  |

This step is to make sure that everyone has a chance to voice their thoughts on all the options and their opinions of each so that they feel that all the options are given a chance.

__Formal Opinions__

It is possible to carry out a formal vote on decisions.md to understand the opinion of the Solid Team, Solid Panel, or Solid Community on the specific suggestion. 

This is done by opening a pull request with the question, options, and pros and cons of each and asking the relevant individuals to express their vote by commenting on the pull request. 

The Solid Team is responsible for counting the votes and publishing the results on decisions.md. 

__Final Decision__

Decisions about Solid other than appointing individuals to roles, such as those listed below, are made in the following way. 

* Changes to the Solid specification
* Changes to the [Solid roadmap](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roadmap.md)
* Changes to the Solid Test Suite
* Starting or changing the aim or project manager of a [Solid Project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) i.e. a GitHub project in the Solid Github account

The final decision is made by the Solid Team except the Solid Leader. 

The Solid Team's deliberations and votes shall be held in public.

To use its powers, the Solid Team votes. The Solid leader can always veto the voting outcome. Every Solid Team member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Members with conflicts of interest on a particular vote must abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members.

This is done by opening a pull request on decisions.md and inviting each Solid Team member to vote. The majority votes determine the outcome. If the decision is 50:50 then the Solid Leader will need to step in and make the fith decisive vote. 

If a Solid Team speaks on behalf of the Solid Team they must reference a record of the vote that has been recognised by all Solid Team members except the Solid Leader. 

The Solid Leader should always be made aware of decisions and has the ability to veto a decision at any point.

__Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).

# Solid Specification 

Solid specification 0.8 will be released on July 1st, and new versions of the Solid specification will be released every six months. For a change to the Solid specification to be merged there needs to be at least one working implementation that adheres to the changed Solid specification.
