# Decision Making

## Solid Team

Transparency in the decision making process is important. Decisions will be documented along with the rationale and considerations taken into account around a given decision. The Solid Team always strives to operate in a manner that aims for team consensus without the need for formalized voting.

For any substantial decisions where consensus cannot be reached, the Solid Team votes. As the Solid Leader, Tim Berners-Lee can always veto the voting outcome. Every Solid Team member must either vote or explicitly abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining Solid Team members. Stalemates are resolved by the Solid Leader, Tim Berners-Lee.

The Solid Team utilizes this [Decision Making Process](#decision-making-process).

## Solid Panels

Solid Panels are expected to use this [Decision Making Process](#decision-making-process), to be transparent in work being conducted under their mandate, and to provide regular status updates through established channels.

Solid Panels should always strive to operate in a manner that aims for consensus without the need for formalized voting. When voting is necessary, stalemates are resolved by a majority vote of the Solid Team. The Solid Team reserves the right to raise any decisions made or in-process within a Panel to a vote by the Solid Team.

## Decision Making Process

We employ a framework for making decisions on the Solid Team and across Solid Panels. As a general rule, this framework should be applied to any substantial choices at a Team or Panel level to ensure informed and thoughtful decisions.

This process may take place on or across different mediums. Wherever it transpires, what is most important is that the process is inclusive for those individuals that have a part in making the decision, and transparent for those who would be impacted by the same.

1. __Identify the Problem__ - The problem and the reason why the problem needs to be solved must be well understood. This includes an understanding of how solving the problem supports the Solid Roadmap.

2. __Lay out Options__ - Detail reasonable paths forward, including pros and cons for each option. This is important to ensure that informed decisions are made.

3. __Invite Conversation__ - Ensure that decision makers and (in most cases) affected parties have reviewed the material and have the ability to provide their input. Oftentimes, this occurs within Github, but can extend out into group calls, group chats, community meetings, and more.

  *If you'd like to add this to the agenda of an upcoming community group meeting, you will need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group, then request that it be added to the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified, and therefore are able to review and/or comment ahead of the call.*

4. __Reach Consensus or Vote__ - Decision makers should strive to reach a simple consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, they should conduct a vote by simple majority.

5. __Document and Communicate__ - Once a decision is made, the reason why should be documented, and then included as part of a notification through established communication channels (as appropriate).
