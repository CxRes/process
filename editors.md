# Solid Editors

Below is a listing of the Solid Editorial Team and their respective assignments. See [Reviewing Proposals](README.md#reviewing-proposals.md) for an explanation of how the editorial process is used to review and accept changes to Solid Specifications, the Solid Roadmap, and Supporting Documentation.

## Editorial Assignments

Editorial assignments are broken into three sections; [Solid Specification](#solid-specification), [Solid Roadmap](#solid-roadmap), and [Supporting Documentation](#supporting-documentation).

### Solid Specification

The Solid Specification covers a broad range of topics, from resource access and decentralized authentication to data portability and querying. Consequently, it requires a group of individuals with a wide range of skillsets to provide thorough editorial review of proposals to extend or alter the specification.

Editorial assignments to the specification are by topic. A given editor may be assigned to one or more topics. Some topics may have dedicated primary documents, while other topics may occur throughout the specification.

-   [Resource Access](#resource-access)
-   [Identity](#identity)
-   [Authentication](#authentication)
-   [Authorization](#authorization)
-   [Events and Notifications](#events-and-notifications)
-   [Data Interoperability](#data-interoperability)
-   [Data Portability](#data-portability)
-   [Auditing](#auditing)
-   [Querying](#querying)
-   [Cryptography](#cryptography)
-   [Security](#security)
