## Background

This repository describes the process of crafting Solid, from proposal to implementation, in particular for the following deliverables:

- Solid Specification
- Solid Roadmap
- Supporting Documentation

## Who is involved with Solid?

Everyone is encouraged to read the code of conduct.

### Contributors to Solid
Any individual that has contributed and had changes accepted to the Solid Specifications, the Solid Roadmap, or supporting documentation, has provided a valuable service to the Solid Project and is encouraged to continue to do so.

### Solid Panels
Solid Panels are groups of individuals focused on a specific domain that is relevant to Solid to produce concrete proposals.

Domains can be technical, non-technical, or some combination of the two. For example, a Security Panel could be tasked with evaluation and advancement of the Solid security model.

Solid Panels are listed at [solid-panels.md](solid-panels.md), along with a description of the panel's focus, preferred communication channels, and individuals participating in the panel. Anyone can join a panel or suggest a new panel.

### Stakeholders

#### Solid users
Solid users are individuals, companies or organizations who have access to data stored in a Solid pod.

#### Implementers
Solid implementers are companies or organizations who are implementing the Solid specification. Solid implementers can be identity providers, Pod providers, or Solid app providers, or a combination.  

Stakeholders are listed at [stakeholders.md](stakeholders.md) along with a description of the stakeholder type (user, identity providers, Pod providers, or Solid app providers, or multiple). Anyone can become a Solid stakeholder.

The reason there is a listing of stakeholders and panels is to facilitate feedback as part of the editorial process. It is not mandatory to list yourself.

## Process

What is the process to improve the Solid specification, roadmap, or supporting documentation?

### Drafting proposals

Anyone can propose improvements to the Solid specification, roadmap or supporting documentation, here are some examples of how:

- Submit a pull request or issue on Solid GitHub specification repository
- Write an email to the Solid Authorization Panel mailing list about web access control
- Make a suggestion on Solid gitter about a new Solid Panel
- Participate in an existing panel or suggest a new panel
- Propose an item for the W3C Solid Community Group call

Proposals for substantive changes to the specifications, roadmap, or supporting documentation go through an editorial review process. For example, this would include changes to the normative text of the specifications or the roadmap.

Proposals need to be realistic and reasonable to implement, preferably with example implementations or demonstrable intention to implement.

To legitimize a decision when there is a sense of agreement rewrite the final proposal and ask the Stakeholders and Panels if there are any major objections.

When there are objections notify the Solid Panels and Stakeholders about the final proposal with an invitation to vote. If there are options, detail them along with the implications of the options. The final proposal needs to be open for one week to give others a chance to vote. To show your support for a proposal write +1. To show your disapproval for a proposal write -1 along with a detailed reason for the disapproval and a suggestion for a preferred alternative. To abstain type 0 when you have no opinion. If you don’t vote by the end of the week it will be assumed that you abstain. At the end of the week anyone can publish an overview of the vote results per Solid Panel and Stakeholder.

### Reviewing proposals

Draft proposals to the Solid specification, roadmap or supporting documentation submitted for review go through an editorial process before they are accepted.

Editors will be appointed directly by Tim Berners-Lee as Solid Leader. Editors are listed at [editors.md](editors.md) along with their contact details and affiliations. Anyone can request to be an editor. Editor requests are not reviewed by other editors, rather they are reviewed directly by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) as Solid Leader who is the only one who can appoint Solid editors.

Proposals and the corresponding outcomes of the vote need to be put forward to the editors for review. Three editors need to actively approve with no editors actively rejecting, for the proposal to be accepted. Editors can abstain. A proposal must be open for at least one week before final acceptance. If an editor doesn’t vote by the end of that week it will be assumed that the editor abstained.

The Solid Manager, who is also an editor, is appointed by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) as Solid Leader. The Solid Manager is responsible for actioning the outcome of the vote.

Anyone can submit a proposal to alter the process of crafting Solid as described in this repository. These proposals will not be reviewed by the editors rather they will be reviewed by the Solid Leader only.

### Administration

Administrators are granted administration rights of tools, systems, and services used for advancing the Solid specification, roadmap or supporting documentation, such as the Solid GitHub organization, Solid Gitter, the [Solid forum](https://forum.solidproject.org), and the [Solid website](https://www.solidproject.org).

Administrators will be appointed directly by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) as Solid Leader. Administrators are listed at [administrators.md](administrators.md) along with their contact details and affiliations. Anyone can request to be an administrator. Administrator requests are not reviewed by other Administrators, rather they are reviewed directly by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) as Solid Leader who is the only one who can appoint Solid Administrators.

The Solid Manager, who is also an editor and an administrator, is appointed by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) as Solid Leader and is responsible for implementing the Solid vision of the Solid Leader. For example, by ensuring the process is implemented correctly as well as the outcome being communicated accurately and efficiently.
