This repository details how changes to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) may be proposed and accepted.

Anyone may participate in [this process](https://github.com/solid/process). Please read the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) before doing so.

Anyone may submit a proposal to alter this process. These proposals will not be reviewed by the editors. They will be reviewed only by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl), who is the Solid Director.

## Roles

Any individual that has been involved in proposals to improve the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) has provided a valuable service to the [Solid Project](https://www.solidproject.org) and is encouraged to continue.

All manner of contributions are important - whether identifying problems, asking questions, or proposing normative changes.

There are many problems and ideas best tackled by a group of people with a specific set of domain expertise called Solid Topics. All contributors are listed as having domain expertise on specific Solid Topics. 

### Director 
The Director is [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl) who is responsible for reviewing process proposals, role applications, and solidproject.org drafts. The Director can also veto decisions by editors about [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

### [Manager](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/manager.md)
The [Manager](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/manager.md) is appointed directly by the Director.

The [Manager](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/manager.md) is responsibile for ensuring developers and those paying for developers are accurately aware of what Solid is, that there are clear instructions describing to developers how to implement Solid. The [Manager](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/manager.md) is also responsible for moderating the standardisation of how to build Pods, apps, and identification, in such a way that users can conveniently switch between the components and take the data generated along. 

Specific tasks include but are not limited to: 
* Events: Encourage and support Solid Event organisers by offering calls to brainstorm around finding local hosting facilities, promoting their event within local developer communities and other event organisation related concerns. Ensure that Solid t-shirts and stickers are sent to Solid event organisers and links to Solid events are published on solidproject.org and in This Week in Solid. 
*	Newsletter: Send the This Week in Solid newsletter via Tiny Letter using the content openly developed on GitHub
*	Solidproject.org: coordinate with the Creators to keep content such as app, Pod, and identity listings, press, documentation, tools, tutorials, and libraries up to date 
*	Public Speaking: Respond to public speaking requests about Solid either by presenting or supporting to find public speakers who are able to present on Solid 
* Support: Ensure that there are clear instructions describing to developers how to implement Solid, for example by facilitating online conversations where developers implementing Solid can ask questions and receive answers to clarify doubts about more advanced questions about the implementation of Solid. This could happen, for example, on the Solid Forum or via an FAQ page on solidproject.org.  
*  Metrics: record data on the first of every month to quantify the amount of implementation of  Solid
*	W3C Solid Community Group Call: Moderate a weekly hour long W3C Solid Community Group call where anyone can drop by to introduce themselves and ask questions. 
*	Process: maintain a public repository explaining how individuals can contribute to the standardisation process effectively and efficiently. Ensure that the Solid GitHub account and gitter is well organised so individuals working there know where to contribute what where. Facilitate a common understanding between editors and panellists about the scope of the immediate sprint in the coming months. Make arrangements so that editors and panellists have regular calls with clear aims.  
*	Moderate: moderate the pathways to make sure that contributors have the space to work while giving others the space to create alongside them.  Ensure that Solid panellists have the tools to facilitate consensus among panellists working on the Solid standard when difficult issues arise. This may involve a series of one-on-one conversations, facilitation of small group discussions, public suggestion of paths forward in the appropriate forum, and collection of feedback.

The [Manager](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/manager.md) has [Admin Permissions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) of all respositories in the [Solid GitHub](https://github.com/solid) as well as  any other tools used for the Solid Project.

### Editors 
Editor appointments and their respective assignments to a specific Solid Topic are made by the Solid Director. The Editorial Team is comprised of all the Editors appointed by the Solid Director, who are listed at [editors.md](editors.md), along with their Solid Topic, contact details, and affiliations. Anyone may apply to be an Editor, and must include one or more requested Solid Topics as part of their application. These requests are not reviewed by other Editors. They are reviewed only by the Solid Director. Editor applications that can demonstrate the support of a relevant panel or group of community members will be favorably considered. Editors belong to the 

[Solid Editors](editors.md) are individuals who are  responsible for editing [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) including processing change proposals as explained below and ensuring that conversations that have happened about Solid are reflected in the [Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

[Editorial Team](https://github.com/orgs/solid/teams/editors) in the [Solid GitHub Organization](https://github.com/solid).

Editors have [Admin Permissions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) of the [Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification).

* Weekly Editor call 

If it is not possible to reach an [Editor](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/editors.md) for four consequetive weeks without explanation or previous arrangements being made to ensure that the responsibilities are fulfilled in the interim period that the Editor will be delisted on [editors.md](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/master/editors.md) by the Manager indicating that they are inactive.

### Panellists 
A [Solid Panel](#solid-panels) is a group of individuals focused a specific Solid Topic with a defined aim. Solid Panels author proposals to change [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel.

Domains may be technical, non-technical, or some combination of the two. For example, a Security Panel could focus on the evaluation and advancement of the Solid security model.

A list of Solid Panels is maintained at [panels.md](panels.md). This listing helps people find panels they may want to participate in, and helps editors find panels to consult as part of the editorial process.

Panels that are inactive for more than three months may be archived by the Manager. Inactive Solid panels can be activated at any point by anyone and there must be immediate and sustained demonstratable activity in the form of contributions on Solid [issues](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls) associated to the topic for the [next upcoming milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones).  

Panellists belong to the [Panllist Team](https://github.com/orgs/solid/teams/panellists) in the [Solid GitHub Organization](https://github.com/solid).

## How to Make Changes to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification)

This section details how changes to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) may be drafted, submitted, and accepted.

### Drafting proposals

Anyone may propose improvements to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Panellists work in [issues in the Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues) which need to have a Solid Topic label indicating which panel is working it. Editors are responsible for ensuring that every issue in the [Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification) has a Solid Topic label.

Communication should be concentrated on issues and pull requests on the Solid repository and not on [Solid gitter channels]((https://gitter.im/solid)) or sepearte repositories to make sure that everyone can keep track of all the relevant conversations. 

On the 19th of every month there is a predefined [milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones) which includes all the issues and pull requests that are being worked on. The title of each pull request or issue needs to clearly define the exact required outcome. 

Anyone can suggest which issues and pull reqeusts should be included in the upcoming milestone by writting a note in the  [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/solid/specification) including a link to the issue or pull request. The Solid Director approves the next milestone on the 19th. 

### Submitting proposals

Proposals for substantive changes to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) go through an editorial review process. A change is considered substantive when it alters the normative text of the Solid. Any proposal must be realistic and reasonable to implement, preferably with example implementations, and demonstrable support from Implementers.

Any proposal should also be accompanied with a reasonable explanation of the need for the proposed change. For example:

- Adding a new capability that satisfies one or more new use cases, or to reflect a new capability already incorporated consistently into multiple implementations.
- Removing something because it was never adopted by Implementers for legitimate reasons, or because there has been a collective shift in focus away from that feature and it no longer makes sense to keep it.
- Changing something to a simpler design that is able to address the same use case(s) with less complexity, or a change that resolves one or more identified issues in real-world use.

To submit a proposal for editorial review any panllist may open a [pull request to the Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls) which clearly links to the issue where the proposal was discussed. The pull request needs to be left open for seven days to give over panellists a chance to suggest improvements. Seven days after the pull request was opened it's ready for editorial review.  

### Reviewing proposals

Candidate proposals to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) submitted for editorial review go through an editorial process before they are accepted.

An Editor determines whether a Candidate Proposal includes a substantive change and marks it accordingly with a label. If there is any disagreement among Editors, the Candidate Proposal will be automatically marked as including a substantive change.

Candidate Proposals with substantive changes require three Editors who are assigned to the material being modified to actively approve the proposal, with no Editors from the Editorial Team actively rejecting. If there are less than three Editors assigned to the material being modified, then other Editors from the Editorial Team may participate.  Editors may abstain. Candidate Proposals with substantive changes must remain open for at least one week before final acceptance. If an Editor does not vote by the end of that week it will be assumed that they abstained, providing a good faith attempt has been made to involve those who may be likely to disagree. Once the Candidate Proposal has successfully passed editorial review and the specified wait-time has elapsed, it may be merged by an assigned Editor.

Candidate Proposals without substantive changes require one Editor assigned to the material being modified to actively approve the proposal, with no Editors from the Editorial Team actively rejecting, and may be merged immediately by an assigned Editor. An assigned Editor may approve and merge their own non-substantive changes. Anyone from the Editorial Team has the right to revert a non-substantive change, but are encouraged to communicate with the assigned Editor that merged it first. Any revert must be accompanied by a reasonable explanation. If the change is reverted because they believe it to be substantive, that must be included in the explanation.

# Solidproject.org Website 

The solidproject.org website is linked to the [`master` branch of the GitHub repo solid/solidproject.org](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/tree/master). Draft versions of updates of the website are worked on in the [`staging` branch of the same repo](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/tree/staging). The draft work is documented on the [Creators project board](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects/12). 

Anyone can make suggestions by commenting or submitting  pull requests to the [`staging` branch of solid/solidproject.org](https://github.com/solid/solidproject.org/tree/staging) to be reviewed by Creators, and be approved by the Solid Director before they go to `master`.

Spelling, grammar, broken links, and other minor changes do not need to be approved by the Solid Director and can be updated directly by the Creators.
