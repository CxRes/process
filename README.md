This document defines the culture of how decisions are made about Solid, and [records how this has changed over time](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/history.md). 

Currently, [Solid decision making](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/decision-making.md) is based around the [Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/solid-team.md) who may also consult the [Solid Panel](https://github.com/solid/culture/blob/master/history.md) (also referred to as Solid Community) for direction via a vote on occasion. 

Solid decision making should be written collaboratively in public over several weeks on the Solid GitHub account and communicated clearly at the weekly W3C Solid Community Group meetings before being presented to the Solid Leader for final approval. The Solid Leader needs to approve any decision-making processes via completing the final merge for it to be legitimate.
