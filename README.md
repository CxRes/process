This repository details how changes to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) may be proposed and accepted.

Anyone may participate in [this process](https://github.com/solid/process). Please read the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) before doing so.

Anyone may submit a proposal to alter this process. These proposals will not be reviewed by the editors. They will be reviewed only by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://github.com/timbl), who is the Solid Director.

## Contributors

Any individual that has been involved in proposals to improve the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) has provided a valuable service to the [Solid Project](https://www.solidproject.org) and is encouraged to continue.

All manner of contributions are important - whether identifying problems, asking questions, or proposing normative changes.

There are many problems and ideas best tackled by a group of people with a specific set of domain expertise called Solid Topics. All contributors are listed as having domain expertise on specific Solid Topics. 

### Panellists 
A [Solid Panel](#solid-panels) is a group of individuals focused a specific Solid Topic with a defined aim. Solid Panels author proposals to change [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Anyone may join a panel or suggest a new panel.

Domains may be technical, non-technical, or some combination of the two. For example, a Security Panel could focus on the evaluation and advancement of the Solid security model.

A list of Solid Panels is maintained at [panels.md](panels.md). This listing helps people find panels they may want to participate in, and helps editors find panels to consult as part of the editorial process.

Panels that are inactive for more than six months may be archived by Solid Administrators.

Panellists belong to the [Panllist Team](https://github.com/orgs/solid/teams/panellists) in the [Solid GitHub Organization](https://github.com/solid).

### Editors 
[Solid Editors](editors.md) are individuals who are collectively responsible for editing [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Editor appointments and their respective assignments to a specific Solid Topic are made by the Solid Director. The Editorial Team is comprised of all the Editors appointed by the Solid Director, who are listed at [editors.md](editors.md), along with their Solid Topic, contact details, and affiliations. Anyone may apply to be an Editor, and must include one or more requested Solid Topics as part of their application. These requests are not reviewed by other Editors. They are reviewed only by the Solid Director. Editor applications that can demonstrate the support of a relevant panel or group of community members will be favorably considered.

Editors belong to the [Editorial Team](https://github.com/orgs/solid/teams/editors) in the [Solid GitHub Organization](https://github.com/solid).

Editors have [Admin Permissions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) of the [Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

## How to Make Changes to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification)

This section details how changes to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) may be drafted, submitted, and accepted.

### Drafting proposals

Anyone may propose improvements to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification). 

Panellists work in [issues in the Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues) which need to have a Solid Topic label indicating which panel is working it. Editors are responsible for ensuring that every issue in the [Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification) has a Solid Topic label.

Communication should be concentrated on issues and pull requests on the Solid repository and not on [Solid gitter channels]((https://gitter.im/solid)) or sepearte repositories to make sure that everyone can keep track of all the relevant conversations. 

On the 19th of every month there is a predefined [milestone](https://github.com/solid/specification/milestones) which includes all the issues and pull requests that are being worked on. The title of each pull request or issue needs to clearly define the exact required outcome. 

Anyone can suggest which issues and pull reqeusts should be included in the upcoming milestone by writting a note in the  [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/solid/specification) including a link to the issue or pull request. The Solid Director approves the next milestone on the 19th. 

### Submitting proposals

Proposals for substantive changes to the [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) go through an editorial review process. A change is considered substantive when it alters the normative text of the Solid. Any proposal must be realistic and reasonable to implement, preferably with example implementations, and demonstrable support from Implementers.

Any proposal should also be accompanied with a reasonable explanation of the need for the proposed change. For example:

- Adding a new capability that satisfies one or more new use cases, or to reflect a new capability already incorporated consistently into multiple implementations.
- Removing something because it was never adopted by Implementers for legitimate reasons, or because there has been a collective shift in focus away from that feature and it no longer makes sense to keep it.
- Changing something to a simpler design that is able to address the same use case(s) with less complexity, or a change that resolves one or more identified issues in real-world use.

To submit a proposal for editorial review any panllist may open a [pull request to the Solid repository](https://github.com/solid/specification/pulls) which clearly links to the issue where the proposal was discussed. The pull request needs to be left open for seven days to give over panellists a chance to suggest improvements. Seven days after the pull request was opened it's ready for editorial review.  

### Reviewing proposals

Candidate proposals to [Solid](https://github.com/solid/specification) submitted for editorial review go through an editorial process before they are accepted.

An Editor determines whether a Candidate Proposal includes a substantive change and marks it accordingly with a label. If there is any disagreement among Editors, the Candidate Proposal will be automatically marked as including a substantive change.

Candidate Proposals with substantive changes require three Editors who are assigned to the material being modified to actively approve the proposal, with no Editors from the Editorial Team actively rejecting. If there are less than three Editors assigned to the material being modified, then other Editors from the Editorial Team may participate.  Editors may abstain. Candidate Proposals with substantive changes must remain open for at least one week before final acceptance. If an Editor does not vote by the end of that week it will be assumed that they abstained, providing a good faith attempt has been made to involve those who may be likely to disagree. Once the Candidate Proposal has successfully passed editorial review and the specified wait-time has elapsed, it may be merged by an assigned Editor.

Candidate Proposals without substantive changes require one Editor assigned to the material being modified to actively approve the proposal, with no Editors from the Editorial Team actively rejecting, and may be merged immediately by an assigned Editor. An assigned Editor may approve and merge their own non-substantive changes. Anyone from the Editorial Team has the right to revert a non-substantive change, but are encouraged to communicate with the assigned Editor that merged it first. Any revert must be accompanied by a reasonable explanation. If the change is reverted because they believe it to be substantive, that must be included in the explanation.
