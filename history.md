The Solid project was started by Tim Berners-Lee, who has served as the Solid Leader from inception. 

Originally, if there was a difference of opinion, parties were encouraged to talk to find a compromise. The Solid MIT academic group were responsible for processing suggestions to a change to the Solid specifications and deciding on the route forward.

If a compromise could not be found between the parties the Solid Leader would make the final judgement.
