# Solid Panel Mandate

The Solid Panels are groups of individuals with a specific defined expertise who may be occasionally consulted for their opinion on a specific area by the Solid Team. 

Solid Panels are responsible for providing comprehensive assessments on routes forward as well as the implications of each of the routes. 

## Solid Panel Nomination 

Anyone can suggest a Solid Panel by submitting a pull request to solid-panellists.md defining the theme. If there are five likes on the pull request then the Solid Panel is activated by the Solid Team mergingig the original pull request. 

Anyone can put themselves forward as a Solid panellist candidate by submitting a pull request to solid-panellists.md including the Panel you would like to join and links to your profile to back up your expertise in that field. If there are five likes on the pull request with the candidate application then you will be accepted to the Panel by one of the Solid Team merging the original pull requset. The Solid Leader can veto candidates to Solid Panels. 

## Solid Panel Removal 

Solid Panellists may resign their position at any time. 

If a Solid Panellist drops out of touch and cannot be contacted for several weeks without notification, then they may be removed from the Solid Panel. 

In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the Solid Panel against their will. (For example: egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations.). Anyone can raise a concern about a specific Solid Panellist by raising a pull request that needs to be reviewed by all Solid Team members except the Solid Leader. If a Solid Team member abstains from approving or expresses some hesitation, then the removal of the Solid applicant must be reviewed by the Solid Leader to be formally removed. 

## Conflicts of Interest

Solid Team members are trusted to act in the best interests of Solid rather than themselves or their employers, the mere appearance of any one company dominating Solid development could itself be harmful and erode trust. In order to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest, at most 30% of the Solid Panel can work for any single employer. Solid Panellist applicants who apply when there is already 30% of the Solid Panel working for their employee will be put on hold until there are more applications from other employers or there are Solid Panellist resignations.
