# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team 
## Purpose
This charter sets out to explain the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team (DEIT). It provides a concise overview of increasing voices in the Solid community by inviting individuals from different ethnic, gender, and other underrepresented groups. The team shall review interactions, make sure there are equal and supportive opportunities for those in underrepresented groups, and make recommendations to the Solid Team and Community.
## Membership
The Team shall consist of both administrators and community members (CM). All administrators and CM join on a volunteer basis. The administrators will serve a term of one year and are appointed by the Director of Solid. Elections are during the first quarter of the year. The prospective administrative candidate can put their name in or by a member’s suggestion. No specific administrator can serve more than three consecutive terms in their respective role. The administrators are:
* Lead Administrator: Marrelle Bailey
* Administrator: Sarven Capadisli 
* Administrator: Jeff Zucker 
* Administrator: Kyra Assaad
* Administrator: Virginia Balseiro 
The Director of Solid and administrators will determine the number of team members, always greater than two, and meet or exceed regulatory requirements. All those in an administrator role must disclose outside ties to organizations/directorships. Make sure to inform the DEIT of any changes like directorships when the changes take place. Ties that should be disclosed are working with organizations or companies affiliated with Solid like Janeiro Digital, Inrupt, etc. At this time, there are no issues with having multiple affiliations in the Solid community. Anyone can join. The administrators shall establish and approve formal and transparent remuneration policies and procedures for all team members. Administrators do not get paid for any directors’ fees. No fees will be required to join. 
## Authority
The DEIT has no expressed or implied power or authority. Effective governance of the team requires the Solid Team to be involved in all significant decisions and be accountable for the changes the DEIT makes. 
* Increasing diversity, inclusion, and equity throughout the Solid community/ecosystem
    Making recommendations to the Solid Team and Director of Solid to increase opportunities for underrepresented groups to make changes
        Underrepresented groups are not limited to gender, gender identity, education, ethnicity, age, language, disability, and culture. 
* Advocating for the community 
    If either the Solid Team members or community member do not comply with the DEIT’s recommendations or policies. In that case, it will be up to the Solid Team to remedy and/or resolve. They will take action on a case-by-case basis by consulting with the DEIT. 
* Measuring the success behind our recommendations
    Surveys are offered to various community groups to assess education level, expertise, accessibility/disability, gender, and underrepresented groups. 
    Focus groups will be gathered to report on progress; better see how we can support outside groups or individuals to join or thrive in Solid. 
## Responsibilities
The DEI Team administrators will report their activities to the Director of Solid, in summary, published quarterly.
Creating a plan for diversity and inclusion with best practices. Also working alongside the W3C’s D&I Group and the PWE CG in mind. 
Increase outreach of Solid’s work into communities with underrepresented groups. 
Achieve gender equity building a voice, volunteer/job opportunities, and work in the Solid community
## Meetings
The DEIT will meet at least quarterly and more often as needed. A majority of the team members shall constitute a quorum. The lead administrator will keep a copy of the team meeting minutes and forward a copy to the board secretary. The administrators may invite any director, officer, staff member, expert, or other advisors who aren’t a committee member to sit in, listen, and advise for support. But these individuals will have no voting power.
The committee will review its charter twice a year and recommend any proposed changes to the board for review. This document will also be available to the public. If you would like to make changes, please submit a PR.
